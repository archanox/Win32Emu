# IGN_TEAS Execution Stall - Diagnostic Report

## Executive Summary

The IGN_TEAS.EXE test executes successfully for 5 seconds but "stalls" in an infinite loop after C runtime initialization, never reaching DirectX initialization code. This report documents the findings from running the test with enhanced debug logging.

## Test Behavior

### What Works ✅
- Executable loads successfully
- PE imports are mapped (83 imports including DDRAW.dll, DINPUT.dll, DSOUND.dll)
- C runtime initialization completes
- Win32 APIs are called and return successfully:
  - GetVersion, HeapCreate, VirtualAlloc (2x)
  - GetStartupInfoA, GetStdHandle (3x), GetFileType (3x)
  - SetHandleCount, GetACP, GetCPInfo
  - GetCommandLineA, GetEnvironmentStringsW
  - WideCharToMultiByte (2x), FreeEnvironmentStringsW
  - GetModuleFileNameA (returns path "EXEs/ign_teas/IGN_TEAS.EXE")

### What Doesn't Work ❌
- DirectX functions (DirectDrawCreate, DirectInputCreate) are **NEVER** called
- Program enters infinite loop after GetModuleFileNameA
- EBP register is 0x00000000 (should point to stack frame)
- ExitProcess is never called
- Test times out after 5 seconds as designed

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Infinite Loop

After GetModuleFileNameA returns 0x1A (26 bytes), execution continues at address 0x004123B8. The program then enters a tight loop executing these instructions repeatedly:

```
Loop addresses (repeating every ~10,000 instructions):
- 0x00412513
- 0x00412543
- 0x00412594
- 0x00412545 (where EBP=0 is detected)
```

**Execution stats:**
- ~2.5 million instructions in 4 seconds
- Completes one loop cycle every ~100-150 instructions
- Loop detected at instruction 10,000 and continues indefinitely

### Register State in Loop

```
EIP: Cycles through 0x00412513 → 0x00412543 → 0x00412594 → 0x00412545
ESP: 0x001FFF44 (normal - stack pointer is correct)
EBP: 0x00000000 (SUSPICIOUS - base pointer should not be zero!)
```

**Why EBP=0 is problematic:**
- EBP (base pointer) should point to the current function's stack frame
- EBP=0 indicates either:
  1. Stack frame was not set up properly
  2. EBP was corrupted during a function call/return
  3. Game intentionally uses EBP=0 (unusual but possible)

### Why DirectX Is Never Called

According to decompilation analysis (DECOMPILATION_FINDINGS.md), the game's initialization sequence should be:

```c
int WinMain(...) {
    timeBeginPeriod(1);  // ✅ Works
    sub_404B00();        // ✅ Works 
    
    if (!sub_403510())   // ❌ Should call this, but never reached
        return 0;
    
    // Main loop - never reached
}

int sub_403510() {
    iVar1 = FUN_00404640();  // DirectDraw init
    if (iVar1 != 0) {
        iVar1 = FUN_004046f0();  // DirectInput init
        ...
    }
}
```

**The program never calls sub_403510()** because it's stuck in the loop before reaching that code.

## What the Loop Is Doing

Based on the execution pattern, this appears to be a **busy-wait/polling loop** that's waiting for some condition that will never be satisfied in the emulator. Possibilities include:

1. **Waiting for a window message** - Game may be polling for WM_CREATE or other window messages
2. **Waiting for a timer** - Game may be waiting for GetTickCount() or timeGetTime() to reach a value
3. **Waiting for initialization flag** - Some global variable that should be set by a missing API or callback
4. **Checking hardware state** - Polling for keyboard/mouse initialization

## Comparison with Documentation

The decompilation findings stated:
> "The game doesn't call any unimplemented Win32 APIs ✅  
> It's not stuck in a loop polling for something ✅  
> It's **silently failing** during DirectX initialization ❌"

**This is incorrect!** The diagnostic shows:
- ✅ The game doesn't call unimplemented Win32 APIs (TRUE)
- ❌ It **IS** stuck in a loop polling for something (NEW FINDING)
- ❌ It never reaches DirectX initialization to fail there (NEW FINDING)

## Recommended Next Steps

### Investigation
1. **Disassemble the loop addresses** (0x00412513-0x00412594) to understand what the code is doing
2. **Check what condition is being tested** - What makes the loop exit?
3. **Identify missing API or callback** - What initialization is the game waiting for?

### Potential Fixes
1. **Window creation** - If waiting for window messages, ensure proper window/message loop setup
2. **Timer initialization** - If waiting for timer, ensure timeBeginPeriod and timer APIs work
3. **Callback registration** - If waiting for callback, identify and implement missing callback
4. **Force loop exit** - As last resort, patch the executable to skip the wait loop

### Testing
1. Use interactive debugger to step through loop and identify the conditional branch
2. Examine memory at the addresses being checked in the loop
3. Set breakpoint at 0x00412513 and examine what value is being tested

## Files Modified

- `Win32Emu/Emulator.cs` - Added loop detection logging and suspicious register details
- `Win32Emu.Tests.Emulator/IgnitionTeaserTests.cs` - Enabled debug mode
- `Win32Emu.Tests.Emulator/IgnitionTeaserDiagnosticTests.cs` - Created diagnostic test (unused)

## How to Reproduce

```bash
cd /home/runner/work/Win32Emu/Win32Emu

# Run test
dotnet test Win32Emu.Tests.Emulator --filter "Name~IgnitionTeaser_ShouldLoadAndRun"

# OR run emulator directly with debug logging
dotnet run --project Win32Emu -- EXEs/ign_teas/IGN_TEAS.EXE --debug 2>&1 | grep "Loop Check"
```

Expected output shows loop cycling through the same addresses:
```
[Loop Check] Instruction 10000: EIP=0x00412513
[Loop Check] Instruction 20000: EIP=0x00412543
[Loop Check] Instruction 30000: EIP=0x00412594
[Loop Check] Instruction 40000: EIP=0x00412513
...
```

## Conclusion

The IGN_TEAS.EXE test doesn't "stall" in the traditional sense - it executes millions of instructions but is trapped in a polling loop waiting for a condition that never occurs. The root cause is **not** DirectX COM vtable issues (which are already fixed) but rather a missing Win32 API, callback, or initialization that the game expects before proceeding to DirectX setup.

The EBP=0 condition suggests potential stack corruption or unusual calling convention, but this may be a red herring if the game intentionally uses EBP for other purposes.

**Key takeaway:** The game needs something from the emulator environment that it's not getting, causing it to wait indefinitely before attempting DirectX initialization.
