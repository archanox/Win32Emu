# Implementation Summary: Persistent Game Library Storage

## Issue Addressed
Game Library does not persist between launches of the application

## Solution Implemented
Integrated Config.Net library to provide cross-platform persistent storage for:
- Game library (games with play counters)
- Watched folders
- Emulator configuration settings

## Key Changes

### 1. Added Dependencies
- Config.Net (v5.2.1) - Configuration management library

### 2. New Files Created
- `Configuration/IAppConfiguration.cs` - Configuration interface with Config.Net attributes
- `Configuration/ConfigurationService.cs` - Service managing config load/save operations
- `CONFIGURATION.md` - Documentation for the configuration system

### 3. Modified Files
- `ViewModels/GameLibraryViewModel.cs` - Added load/save functionality
- `ViewModels/SettingsViewModel.cs` - Auto-save settings on change
- `ViewModels/MainWindowViewModel.cs` - ConfigurationService integration
- `README.md` - Updated with new features
- `Win32Emu.Gui.csproj` - Added Config.Net package reference

## How It Works

### Storage Location
Configuration is stored in a platform-agnostic location:
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Win32Emu\config.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/Win32Emu/config.json`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Win32Emu/config.json`

### Automatic Persistence
- **On Startup**: All saved games, folders, and settings are loaded automatically
- **On Game Add**: Game list is immediately saved to config
- **On Game Launch**: Play counter increments and saves before emulator starts
- **On Game Remove**: Updated list is saved
- **On Settings Change**: Settings auto-save when any value changes

### Data Stored
```json
{
  "RenderingBackend": "Software",
  "ResolutionScaleFactor": 1,
  "ReservedMemoryMB": 256,
  "WindowsVersion": "Windows 95",
  "EnableDebugMode": false,
  "GamesJson": "[{\"Title\":\"Game1\",\"ExecutablePath\":\"...\",\"TimesPlayed\":5,\"LastPlayed\":\"...\"}]",
  "WatchedFolders": "C:\\Games;D:\\OldGames"
}
```

## Testing Performed
✅ Project builds without errors or warnings
✅ Config.Net library independently verified
✅ Configuration paths verified for cross-platform compatibility
✅ Code review completed

## Verification Steps
To verify the implementation works:
1. Run the GUI application
2. Add a game to the library
3. Launch the game (play counter should increment)
4. Close the application
5. Reopen the application
6. Verify the game is still in the library with the correct play count
7. Check that the config file exists at the platform-specific location

## Notes
- The implementation uses minimal changes to existing code
- All persistence is automatic - no manual save button required
- TimesPlayed counter increments before launching games
- Settings persist immediately when changed
- The system is fully cross-platform compatible
