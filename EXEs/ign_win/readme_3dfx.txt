Thank you for downloading the 3Dfx patch for Ignition.

This is Release 2 which fixes some bugs and cosmetical issues.
It also speeds up the game in general.

First of all, this 3Dfx patch of Ignition only works with Windows 95, so 
don't try to run it from DOS. Also, you must run it with the full version
of the game; it won't run with the demo.

Second, make sure you unzip all the files using directories (e.g. 
pkunzip -d) to your Ignition folder.

Then double-click on the ign_3dfx.exe file and Ignition starts running with 
your 3Dfx card. Make sure you have your 3Dfx card correctly installed 
with all glide drivers.
