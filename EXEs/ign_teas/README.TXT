Welcome

Thanks for downloading the teaser demo of Ignition, the new hi-speed car
racing game from Virgin Interactive and UDS.



How to run
----------

First of all this teaser demo of Ignition is designed for Windows 95(tm) and
directX(tm) only (The full game comes in both Windows 95(tm) and DOS versions).
If you don't have directX 3.0 or higher installed on your computer you can
download it for free from Micosoft(tm) at:

http://www.microsoft.com/mediadev/download/isdk.htm
http://www.microsoft.com/windows/pr/win95osr.htm

If the demo replies with a dialog box saying "Can find dinstall.dll" when you
start it you does not have directX 3.0 or higer installed.

When you have installed directX you just doubleclick on the Ignition.exe icon
and the demo starts. No more installation is required.



Keys
----

When the demo is running you can press the plus and minus 
keys on your computer to change resolution. Esc, space or 
return quits the demo.

If you have problems with shifting resolution it's probably
because you have 'Num lock' turned on. Press num lock and
try again.


Features in the full game
-------------------------

* Ignition includes seven extremely well designed
  tracks. Jump out from waterwalls, over canyons or
  over roads and huge steeps. Select your route when
  the track splits up. Watch out for falling rocks,
  tornados and avalanches. Race along the railway or
  take a shortcut over the airport runway.

* Select your car from eleven exotic vehicles like a
  police car, school bus or monster truck.

* Play single, two player splitscreen or multiplayer
  over Internet, LAN, modem or serial link.

* Four different race modes: championship, single
  race, training and pursue mode.

* Advanced computer-controlled cars that also make
  mistakes like spinning and crashing.

* Transparent skidmarks, smoke, sparks and fire add
  a new level of realism to the game.

* Transparent textures create great water effects
  never yet seen in a racing game on the PC.

* Weather effects like rain, fog and snow.

* Realtime anti-aliasing takes the visuals to
  arcade-machine heights in even the lower
  resolutions.

* Optional mip mapping.

* Keyboard, joystick or steering-wheel control.
