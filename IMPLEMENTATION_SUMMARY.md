# Implementation Summary: Avalonia GUI for Win32Emu

## Overview
This pull request implements a cross-platform desktop GUI for Win32Emu using Avalonia UI framework, as requested in issue #[issue number].

## What Was Implemented

### 1. New Avalonia MVVM Project (Win32Emu.Gui)
- Created a new cross-platform desktop application using Avalonia 11.3.6
- Follows MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern for clean separation of concerns
- Uses CommunityToolkit.Mvvm for efficient MVVM implementation
- Targets .NET 9.0 with implicit usings enabled

### 2. Core Features

#### Game Library Management
- **Game Library View**: Grid-based layout showing games as cards with thumbnails
- **Add Game Functionality**: File picker to select Windows executable (.exe) files
- **Game Information Display**: Shows title, description, and play statistics
- **Launch Games**: One-click launching of games through the emulator
- **Remove Games**: Ability to remove games from the library

#### Emulator Configuration
- **Settings View**: Comprehensive configuration panel with the following options:
  - **Rendering Backend**: Software, DirectDraw, or Glide
  - **Resolution Scale Factor**: 1x to 4x upscaling
  - **Reserved Memory**: 64MB to 2048MB allocation
  - **Windows Version**: Windows 95, 98, ME, NT 4.0, 2000, or XP
  - **Debug Mode**: Toggle for enhanced debugging

#### Navigation
- **Sidebar Navigation**: Clean icon-based navigation between Library and Settings
- **Content Area**: Dynamic content switching based on navigation

### 3. Architecture

#### Models
- `Game`: Represents a game with title, executable path, thumbnail, description, and statistics
- `EmulatorConfiguration`: Stores all emulator settings
- `GameLibrary`: Collection of games with associated configuration

#### ViewModels
- `MainWindowViewModel`: Manages navigation and coordinates between views
- `GameLibraryViewModel`: Handles game library operations (add, remove, launch)
- `SettingsViewModel`: Manages emulator configuration with two-way binding

#### Views (AXAML)
- `MainWindow`: Main application window with sidebar and content area
- `GameLibraryView`: Game library interface with grid layout
- `SettingsView`: Settings form with dropdowns and inputs

#### Services
- `EmulatorService`: Handles launching the Win32Emu executable with configured settings

### 4. User Experience

#### Adding Games
1. Click "Add Game" button in the library view
2. File picker opens filtered to .exe files
3. Game is automatically added with filename as title
4. Game card appears in library with default thumbnail (ðŸŽ® emoji)

#### Configuring Emulator
1. Navigate to Settings via sidebar
2. Modify any settings (changes are immediately saved)
3. Settings apply to all future game launches

#### Launching Games
1. Click "Launch" button on any game card
2. Win32Emu process starts with the game executable
3. Play statistics (times played, last played) are updated

### 5. Cross-Platform Support
- Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux (Avalonia native support)
- Uses Fluent theme for modern, native-like appearance
- Supports light/dark mode based on system settings

### 6. Documentation
- **Win32Emu.Gui/README.md**: Comprehensive guide for using the GUI
- **Win32Emu.Gui/UI_MOCKUP.md**: Visual mockups of the interface
- **Updated main README.md**: Includes information about the GUI component

## Technical Details

### Dependencies Added
- `Avalonia` (11.3.6): UI framework
- `Avalonia.Desktop` (11.3.6): Desktop platform support
- `Avalonia.Themes.Fluent` (11.3.6): Modern Fluent theme
- `Avalonia.Fonts.Inter` (11.3.6): Inter font family
- `CommunityToolkit.Mvvm` (8.2.1): MVVM helpers and source generators

### Project Structure
```
Win32Emu.Gui/
â”œâ”€â”€ Assets/              # Application icons
â”œâ”€â”€ Models/              # Data models
â”œâ”€â”€ Services/            # Business logic services
â”œâ”€â”€ ViewModels/          # View models with MVVM logic
â”œâ”€â”€ Views/               # AXAML views and code-behind
â”œâ”€â”€ App.axaml            # Application definition
â”œâ”€â”€ Program.cs           # Entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ ViewLocator.cs       # View resolution logic
â””â”€â”€ README.md            # Documentation
```

### Integration with Win32Emu
- References the Win32Emu project
- Launches Win32Emu as a separate process
- Passes command-line arguments including executable path and debug flag
- Configuration is read from the shared EmulatorConfiguration model

## Testing

### Build Verification
- Solution builds successfully in both Debug and Release configurations
- No build errors introduced
- All existing tests continue to pass (99/101, with 2 pre-existing failures)

### Manual Testing Required
The GUI cannot be fully tested in the CI environment due to lack of display server. 
Users should:
1. Run `dotnet run --project Win32Emu.Gui`
2. Verify the main window appears with navigation sidebar
3. Test adding a game via file picker
4. Test navigating to settings and modifying configuration
5. Test launching a game (requires a valid Win32 executable)

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for MVP)

As noted in the issue comments, potential future enhancements include:
- Game metadata fetching from online databases (gamesdb.launchbox-app.com, thegamesdb.net, mobygames.com, wikidata)
- Custom thumbnail support
- Game-specific configuration overrides
- Save state management
- Controller configuration UI
- Recent games list
- Search and filter in library

## Changes Made

### New Files
- All files in `Win32Emu.Gui/` directory (21 files)
- Updated `Win32Emu.sln` to include GUI project
- Updated main `README.md`

### Modified Files
- `Win32Emu.sln`: Added GUI project reference

### No Breaking Changes
- All changes are additive
- No modifications to existing Win32Emu core functionality
- Existing command-line interface remains unchanged

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a solid foundation for a cross-platform game library GUI that meets the requirements specified in the issue. The UI is user-friendly, follows modern design patterns, and provides all the core functionality needed to manage games and configure the emulator.
