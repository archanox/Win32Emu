Welcome to 'Ignition', the fastest racing game for your PC.

This file includes some hints and tips that we might have
forgotten to write in the manual.


Problem
-------

Ignition won't start, the message 'Please insert the
Ignition CD in your CD-Rom drive' appears on the screen
even though I have the CD in the drive.

Solution
--------

Remove all CD-Players or other programs that uses the CD
that may be running in the background. Ignition can't use
the CD if there is other programs running that is using
the CD-ROM.


Problem
-------

Ignition crashes right after the menu, while its trying to
load a track.

Solution
--------

You are probably running the the game from the CD. Always
use the install program and install the game to your
harddisk then run the game from there.


Problem
-------

Ignition crashes in the game at different times and returns to
windows desktop. As it seems, without any reason.

Solution
--------

Turn off the perspective corrected polygons in the gfx menu.
Our perspective polygons routine seems to have problems to work
on some computer systems. If you really want to use perspective
corrected polygons, wait for the 3dfx patch to be released later 
this fall.


Keys
----
Those keys was added after the manual was printed:

Use Tab to change view after a race and use the "`" key 
(the one below the esc key) to turn on/off the race results.


Mipmapping in DOS
-----------------

We had to turn off mipmapping in DOS mode due to some
memory problems with DOS. Use the Win95 version if you 
want to use mipmapping.
