Features in the full game
-------------------------

* Ignition includes seven extremely well designed
  tracks. Jump out from waterwalls, over canyons or
  over roads and huge steeps. Select your route when
  the track splits up. Watch out for falling rocks,
  tornados and avalanches. Race along the railway or
  take a shortcut over the airport runway.

* Select your car from eleven exotic vehicles like a
  police car, school bus or monster truck.

* Play single, two player splitscreen or multiplayer
  LAN, modem or serial link.

* Four different race modes: championship, single
  race, training and pursue mode.

* Advanced computer-controlled cars that also make
  mistakes like spinning and crashing.

* Transparent skidmarks, smoke, sparks and fire add
  a new level of realism to the game.

* Transparent textures create great water effects
  never yet seen in a racing game on the PC.

* Weather effects like rain, fog and snow.

* Realtime anti-aliasing takes the visuals to
  arcade-machine heights in even the lower
  resolutions.

* Optional mip mapping.

* Keyboard, joystick or steering-wheel control.
